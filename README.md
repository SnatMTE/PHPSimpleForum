# PHP Simple Forum
Honestly there is no real purpose to this forum. I was bored one night dog sitting and decided "hey, I never actually made a forum before". I set out to make a basic forum just so I could say I did.

It is very basic and allows people to sign up, post a new topic and a reply. I haven't checked for any security issues but I figured someone might want a basic forum to intergate into something else. If so hey, enjoy and toss me a back link to http://snat.co.uk somewhere!

No real support for this or new features.
