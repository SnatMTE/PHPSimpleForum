# PHP Simple Forum
Honestly there is no real purpose to this forum. I was bored one night dog sitting and decided "hey, I never actually made a forum before". I set out to make a basic forum just so I could say I did. This has no formatting, no template system or anything like that - it is PURELY to show how a forum works. There is no moderation features, no admin feature it just allows someone to sign up and post/reply to a topic. No forgotten password, no storing emails etc - just simple user and password.

I can't stress enough this was purely a practice excercise for me while half asleep. There is no installer but I have provided an SQL file that will make the tables for you via whatever method you want to insert the queries.

The reason I am releasing it is in case someone wants to integrate a basic forum into their own code with their code handling login information etc or just to see how a basic forum actually works. 

No real support for this or new features.
